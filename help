Little Shell.

lsh is a shell with very few features. Some builtin function and execute external programs.

Builtin Function

    change current directory
    
    1. use `cd ~` to home folder;
    2. use `cd -` to last directory;

2. alias
    alias some command to a brief version. here is the format:
        alias brief_cmd long version command
    eg.
        alias ll ls -Alh

    the different with bash or other shell implementation is not with `=`

3. unalias
    do not alias command. here is the format 
        unalias brief_cmd

4. type
    judge the command is a builtin function or external program.
    eg.
        type alias
        type ping

5. help
    print help info

6. exit
    you can exit the lsh with `exit` command. or type Ctrl-C twice.

External Programs
-----------------

when type a command which is not an builtin function. the lsh will try to find it from PATH. And run the first matched program.
